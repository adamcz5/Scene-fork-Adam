/// **Why not `visibleFrame` directly.** `visibleFrame` reserves Dock space only
/// on the display the Dock *currently* occupies, and the Dock is not pinned to
/// a display — it hops to whichever screen the pointer last touched the edge
/// of. That makes `visibleFrame` a function of the screen *and recent mouse
/// history*, so applying the same layout twice on the same screen could target
/// rects ~70pt apart. Every window then resized and shifted, and
/// `LayoutEngine`'s sticky pass (10pt tolerance) could not recognize windows
/// that were already in position.
///
/// **The fix.** Reserve the Dock's thickness uniformly on *every* screen.
/// Because the Dock sits on exactly one display at a time, the maximum
/// left/bottom/right inset across all screens *is* the Dock's thickness, and it
/// stays constant as the Dock moves. The top inset stays per-screen: the menu
/// bar does not follow the pointer, so a display without one must not surrender
/// 25pt to a display that has one.
///
/// The trade-off, deliberately accepted: on a multi-display setup the screen
/// the Dock is *not* on gives up the Dock strip. That is the price of "re-apply
/// never moves anything". Single-display users see no change at all — the
/// maximum over one screen is that screen's own inset, so the result equals
/// `visibleFrame` exactly.
